          As a passionate full-stack web developer with a Bachelor's degree in{' '}
          <span>Computer Engineering</span>, I strive to create software that
          not only functions efficiently under the hood, but also provides
          intuitive, pixel-perfect user experiences. I have experience
          developing and designing software for the web, from simple landing
          pages to progressive web applications. I'm always looking for
          opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their
          knowledge as much as I want to learn. <br />
          <br />I regularly solve programming challenges on platforms like{' '}
          <a href="http://leetcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            <span>Leetcode</span>
          </a>
          . Apart from coding, I love solving Cube Puzzles, going to gym,
          travelling to new places and having fun with friends.
